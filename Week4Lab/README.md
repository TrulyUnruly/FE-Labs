Week 4 Lab - FE-Labs
This repository contains the Week 4 lab for the Front End Bootcamp. In this lab, I had the opportunity to apply and reinforce the concepts introduced during the week. Each activity includes a link to the relevant prompts, guiding me through exercises that focus on when, why, and how to use various programming constructs.

These hands-on activities are designed to deepen my understanding of frontend development, expand my problem-solving skills, and help me become a more effective developer.
